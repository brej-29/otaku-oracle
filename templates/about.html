    Hi! I‚Äôm building <strong>Otaku Oracle</strong>‚Äîa slick, professional Django playground where
    anime &amp; manga questions collide with a lightning-fast LLM. Think sh≈çnen-splash energy:
    neon gradients, halftone panels, and panel-wipe motion‚Ä¶ minus the filler arcs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ask about ongoing status, episode/chapter counts, where to stream in your region, ratings,
    cast, OST/OP/ED credits, and more. Got a panel or cover? Drop an image URL and we‚Äôll try to
    make sense of it like a seasoned scanlator.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love this medium‚Äîlate-night fansubs, convention lines, OP lyrics stuck in my head for days.
    This project is a small love letter to my fellow otaku: fast, useful, and unapologetically flashy.
    Welcome home.
  </p>
